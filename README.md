  ## Description

  
   I wanted to utilize my knowledge and solidify my understanding of utilizing sequelize to be able to create a back-end for an existing application.
   It helps make Data more easily created rather than having to use multiple languages to add to database but being able to use models and continue using JavaScript syntax to create and respond to user input.
   I see that there are many tools and packages that are meant to make things a bit more cleaner and efficient for developers and these tools and packages should be used in other projects and or client requests.
